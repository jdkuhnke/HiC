# Honeycombs in Concrete Instance Segmentation (HiCIS)
The directory `HiCIS` contains two datasets for instance segmentation of honeycombs in concrete in COCO Format. The datasets orginate from images scraped from the internet and the other one is provided by Metis Systems AG. The directory `HiCC/web` contains the dataset using the images from the internet and `HICC/metis` contains the dataset using the images provided by Metis Systems AG as part of the research project _Smart Design and Construction (SDaC)_.

# Honeycombs in Concrete Classification (HiCC)

The directory `HiCC` contains images for binary classification of honeycombs in concrete. The datasets were generated by using the instance segmentation of the `HiCIS` dataset. The patches were generated using a stride factor of `0.5`, e.g., stride 300 for patch size 600. The directory `HiCC/web300` and `HiCC/web600` contain images the from the web, using a patch size of 300 and 600 respectively. The directory `HiCC/metis` contains the images from metis, using a patch size of 600.

The dataset under `HiCC/cdc` was created by using the multi-classification dataset of Hung et al., sorting all images but honeycombs images into a single class. Thus creating a binary classification dataset. Please refer to the original author for the dataset `Concrete Damage Classification` ([original repo](https://github.com/tiensu/Concrete_Damage_Classification)) and if you use `HiCC/cdc` cite their work:
